This is a conversion of the IBM ICU implementation of the BigDecimal for ActionScript 3, (Flash or Flex)
Compiled with SDK 3.2.0

Two files are needed, **BigDecimal.as** and **MathContext.as**
You can also take **BigDecimalTest.as** if you need some testing.

Files are in the Source->Browse->Trunk.

Feel free to report bugs or errors if there are any.

Thanks.

OK We are in 2012 now

I no longer work with Flex.

Adobe never did any work to support such an important functionality in finance domain.

So for all of you in financials, NEVER USE FLEX OR FLASH to compute data.
Seriously guys. DONT use that technology. It is the worst thing that ever existed in the world.

Use GWT, or HTML 5. ExtJS, Wicket, or anything else. But dont use stuff from Adobe....
Correction DONT use stuff that Adobe bought from Macromedia. They fucked up everything.

**Oh by the way, did they fix the locale Day Light Saving time. We waited 8 month for that fix. Java fixed it under 10 days. I know this change was a big one, but 8 Months! 8 FUCKING MONTHS!!!!!! How much time did we take to find that the bug was from FLASH!!!!
Clients, normal ones. Like you and me, were in trouble because of that. I dont even know if they fixed it.
Fix: Transfer date in string..... wow. Yes when your daily income is 6 digits you have no choice but imagine the loss in 1 day...**

YES, Our fault. I know. But questions yourself. Are you doing the same kind of error in your applications?

This is my blast, my liberty. Adobe, and to everyone happening to come on this solution for BigDecimal: I will never use any of your technology ever again.

..!.. Adobe.

Lots of frustrations here i know. But not even 10% is written. FOR A PAID SOFTWARE!


Viva GWT, HTML 5.
